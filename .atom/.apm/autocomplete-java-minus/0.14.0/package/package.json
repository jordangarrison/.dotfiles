On UNIX it would look something like\n\n```shell\n/path/to/one/dependency.jar:/home/noseglid/devel/JavaProject/build/classes\n```\n\n`autocomplete-java-minus` will parse `dependency.jar` as well as any\nclass or JAR file under `/home/noseglid/devel/JavaProject/build/classes`\n\n## Why not [autocomplete-java](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-java) ?\n\n`autocomplete-java-minus` differs from `autocomplete-java` in that it:\n\n  * uses [`jdjs`](http://npmjs.com/jdjs) to parse JARs/Classes. It's a native javascript implementation which is way faster, consumes less resources and offers more flexibility than spawning `javap` over and over again.\n  * will only autocomplete. The limited scope will increase maintainability and quality.\n\n\n## What will autocomplete-java-minus _not_ do ?\n\n`autocomplete-java-minus` aims to only handle auto completion. Thus, the following will not be implemented in the scope of this package.\n\n  * Work with import statements (although it does let [java-import-wiz](https://github.com/noseglid/java-import-wiz) know that an autocompletion was made so *it* can work with imports)\n  * Dependency source code download or display\n  * *go to* or *return from* declaration of any kind\n  * Reconstruct source from `.class`-file\n\nWhile these may be desired features, it is left up to other packages to implement.\n\n## Add import statement after autocomplete\n\nIn java it is quite tedious to look up which package/namespace\na class belongs to. `autocomplete-java-minus` will work with\n[java-import-wiz](https://github.com/noseglid/java-import-wiz)\nto automatically insert `import` statements when an autocompletion is accepted.\n\n## State of functionality\n\n### Current features\n\n  * Parse implicit Java JARs (`rt.jar`, `javaws.jar`, etc).\n  * `.classpath` parsing:\n    - JAR files\n    - Class files\n    - Folders (traversed for Class or Jar files)\n\n  * Autocomplete suggestions for parsed classes\n    - Classes (Interfaces, Annotations, etc are all classes)\n    - Constructors with arguments and snippets\n    - Static methods of classes with arguments and snippets\n\n  * Autocomplete non-static members\n    - Fields and members from instanced classes, and it's inherited members\n    - Member fields and methods from superclass\n    - Class local member fields and methods\n    - Method local variables\n\n  * Integrated with [java-import-wiz](https://github.com/noseglid/java-import-wiz) for auto `import` statements.\n\n### Upcomming features\n\n  * Automatically refresh classes in the current project as it's edited.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/noseglid/autocomplete-java-minus/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/noseglid/autocomplete-java-minus#readme","_id":"autocomplete-java-minus@0.14.0","_shasum":"2a278a00a706cad5f9a7aa33032aca021671c5ed","_resolved":"file:../d-117328-3363-184l7xy.4urw9udi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117328-3363-184l7xy.4urw9udi/package.tgz"}
