This is a choice of the build package.\n\n### Usage & Notes\n* If the currently shown file is in one of Atom's paths and there is a makefile in the current file's folder, this provider calls make on that makefile.\n* You should activate the 'Refresh targets when the target list is shown' option in the build package, so that it searches for makefiles when you open the targets list. Useful to detect new makefiles.\n* To match LaTeX errors,invoke your LaTeX engine with the '-file-line-error' command line switch.\n* This package requires [atom-build](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-build) to be installed.\n* Keep an eye on the target names in the list. They might look similar but come from other providers like build-make.\n* *Thanks:* [atom-build-make](https://github.com/AtomBuild/atom-build-make) was a great help creating this package!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tasnad/atom-build-make-file/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tasnad/atom-build-make-file#readme","_id":"build-make-file@0.3.0","_shasum":"57080712c770cfe7e89066ae792bf956c0b3b3ad","_resolved":"file:../d-117328-17788-1jhfbbq.5nzpdp9zfr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117328-17788-1jhfbbq.5nzpdp9zfr/package.tgz"}
