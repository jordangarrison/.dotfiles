I would like to create a xuh-syntax theme eventually.\n\nI use the [tree-view-background](https://atom.io/packages/tree-view-background) package to add some of xuh's art to my tree view. I edited the styles of the package to better suit my theme. If you want to copy this go to `user/.atom/packages/tree-view-background/styles/` and edit `background.less`. My `background.less` looks like this:\n\n```\n.tree-view {\n  background: transparent !important;\n}\n\n.tree-view-background {\n  content: \"\";\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-position: right bottom;\n  background-size: 180px;\n  margin-bottom: -10px;\n  margin-right: -20px;\n  top: 0;\n  bottom: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  right: 0;\n  z-index: -1;\n  position: absolute;\n}\n```\n\nWhich is actually horribly hacky, negative margins and all. I wanted to include the tree-view image in the theme itself, and since I could not [work out](https://discuss.atom.io/t/adding-a-background-image-to-tree-view/39596) how to do so, created a quick solution using this package. If I work out how to add the image using Atom UI themes only, I will create a nice solution.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/louisdeb/xuh-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/louisdeb/xuh-ui#readme","_id":"xuh-ui@0.2.1","_shasum":"bd508c61489bf93978f6d4ae0e86ec1334a63610","_resolved":"file:../d-117328-12560-1seylcm.4w9lnjnhfr/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117328-12560-1seylcm.4w9lnjnhfr/package.tgz"}
