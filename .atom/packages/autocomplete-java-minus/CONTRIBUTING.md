## So you want to contribute. That's great!

Please read and follow these guidelines before you do anything.

### **Want a new feature? Implement it, or wait**

The project is still very young and I already have a long
list of things I want to do. I don't want to maintain a list
of feature requests in issues.

### **Found a bug?**

Please do not open issues unless you've also
taken time to investigate why it's not working and made sure
*it is* a bug (and not a missing feature).

I don't have time nor interest in debugging poorly written
issues with not enough information to act on. I will close
such issues without an explanation.

If you *can* provide enough information, I much welcome the
report!

### **Pull Requests**

Pull requests are always welcome. If you do decide to fix
a bug which is bothering you, or add a feature you just can't live
without, *add specs* and *follow the code style in the project*.

If you add a feature, make sure it is about autocompleting java,
otherwise you're on the wrong project.

Run `npm run lint` to make sure your code is linting.
