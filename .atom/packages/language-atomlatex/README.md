# LaTeX language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets for LaTeX in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/converting-from-textmate)
from the [LaTeX TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/latex.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
